remove napi_get_value_string_length()\n\nThis API doesn't serve much purpose, and is only likely to cause\nconfusion and bugs. The intention was that this would return the\nnumber of characters in a string independent of encoding, but\nthat's not generally useful. In almost all cases, one of the\nencoding-specific napi_get_value_string_* APIs is more correct.\n(Pass a null buffer if only the encoded length is desired.)\n\nAnyway the current implementation of napi_get_value_string_length()\nis technically wrong: it returns the number of 2-byte code units of\nthe UTF-16 encoding, but there are actually some characters that\nare encoded as two UTF-16 code units.\n\nNote the JavaScript String.prototype.length property returns the\nnumber of UTF-16 code units, which may be different from the number\nof characters. So, getting the true character count is not common\nwith JavaScript, and is probably best left to specialized\ninternationalization libraries.\n\nPR-URL:
