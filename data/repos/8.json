It is also selected when the model is set to\n`null` or `undefined`.\n\nWhen the model is set to a value that does not match any option value, and is also not\n`null` or `undefined`, the *unknown* option is inserted and selected - this is an explicit marker\nthat the select is in an invalid / unknown state, which is different from an allowed empty state.\n\nPreviously, regular selects followed this logic, whereas ngOptions selects selected the empty\noption in the case described above.\n\nThis patch makes the behavior consistent between regular / ngOptions select - the latter will now\ninsert and select the unknown option. The order of the options has been fixed to unknown -> empty\n-> actual
