374ad05ab64.\n\nWhile the patch worked great for userspace allocations, the fact that\nsoftirq loses the per-cpu allocator caused problems.

Both are possible but sufficiently tricky that it shouldn't\nbe rushed.\n\nJesper had one method for allowing softirqs but reported that the cost\nwas high enough that it performed similarly to a plain revert.

quirk\n\nI got a couple more reports: the Samsung APST issues appears to\naffect multiple 950-series devices in Dell XPS 15 9550 and Precision\n5510 laptops.  Change the quirk: rather than blacklisting the\nfirmware on the first problematic SSD that was reported, disable\nAPST on all 144d:a802 devices if they're installed in the two\naffected Dell models.  While we're at it, disable only the deepest\nsleep state instead of all of them -- the reporters say that this is\nsufficient to fix the problem.\n\n(I have a device that appears to be entirely identical to one of the\naffected devices, but I have a different Dell laptop, so it's not\nthe case that all Samsung devices with firmware BXW75D0Q are broken\nunder all circumstances.)\n\nSamsung engineers have an affected system, and hopefully they'll\ngive us a better workaround some time soon.  In the mean time, this\nshould minimize regressions.\n\nSee https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1678184\n\nCc: Kai-Heng Feng <kai.heng.feng@canonical.com>\nSigned-off-by: Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Jens Axboe <axboe@fb.com>","tree":{"sha":"825aa0a8058499cd7eea77ee9413cc8dd4a09261","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/trees/825aa0a8058499cd7eea77ee9413cc8dd4a09261"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/git/commits/ff5350a86b20de23991e474e006e2ff2732b218e","comment_count":0},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/ff5350a86b20de23991e474e006e2ff2732b218e","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ff5350a86b20de23991e474e006e2ff2732b218e","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/ff5350a86b20de23991e474e006e2ff2732b218e/comments","author":null,"committer":{"login":"axboe","id":2619634,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2619634?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe","html_url":"https://github.com/axboe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/axboe/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"4981d04dd8f1ab19e2cce008da556d7f099b6e68","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/torvalds/linux/commits/4981d04dd8f1ab19e2cce008da556d7f099b6e68","html_url":"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4981d04dd8f1ab19e2cce008da556d7f099b6e68"}]}]
